# Angela-You-Bio-Readme

I'm an incoming freshman at Northeastern University, studying computer engingeering and computer science. I love logic, solving puzzles, and challenging myself with new hobbies. When I'm not coding, drawing, or playing the piano, you can find me volunteering and teaching foster students coding languages. I want to become a part of this community and hopefully make contributions while improving my cs skills!
